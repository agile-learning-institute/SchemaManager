# mongoSchemaManager Reference

## Overview
The msm tool works by connecting to a mongoDB, reading the configurations you provide and then creating the collections, schemas, and indexes described in those configurations. This document describes what those configuration options are and how to use them.

## Schema Folders
At runtime the schema manager will read configuration from the following collection of folders. 
- **collections** - collection configuration files
- **customTypes** - custom type definitions
- **enumerators** - system enumerators
- **schemas** - collection schemas
- **testData** - test data files 

## collections configuration files
Collection configuration files, found in the collections folder, drive all of msm processing. A single configuration file will conform to the [configuration file schema](./docs/config-schema.json), and describe a collection and how it changes over time. Each version of the collection has a Version Number and a schema document. The configuration of a version of the collection may also specify test data to be loaded, indexes to be created or dropped, and migrations that need to be run to update the data.

### Collection Version Numbers
Schema version numbers follow the semantic versioning practice, and add a Enumerators overlay. Schema version numbers consist of 4 numbers seperated by periods (.) with the following meanings:

- Major: Will change with significant breaking changes. These are usually acompanied by migrations and index changes.
- Minor: Will change with minimal loss of functionality, increasing a constraint or removing depricated properties. 
- Patch: Will change with minor, non-breaking changes such as adding new properties, or changing indexes. 
- Enumerators: Will refer to the version of system enumerators used in schema pre-processing. 

### Enumerations
Enumerations are A gold standard with regard to data quality. There are however complications that impede their use, but msm has a way to address those complications and simplify the use of enumerators. The use of enum schema constraints typically faces three problems:
- they don't describe the values
- the UI needs to know them
- they can't be reused by different collections

msm uses the ``enumerators/enumerators.json`` file, which provides descriptions in addition to the enumerated values. This data is used during schema pre-processing to support re-use. The msm process will create an enumerators collection that contains this data so that it can be served to UI consumers. Here is a sample enumerators file with 3 versions.
```json
[
    {
        "name": "Enumerations",
        "status": "Depricated",
        "version": 0,
        "enumerators": {}
    },
    {
        "name": "Enumerations",
        "status": "Active",
        "version": 1,
        "enumerators": {
            "defaultStatus": {
                "Active":"Not Deleted",
                "Archived":"Soft Delete Indicator"
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "name": "Enumerations",
        "status": "Active",
        "version": 2,
        "enumerators": {
            "defaultStatus": {
                "Draft":"Not Complete",
                "Active":"Not Deleted",
                "Archived":"Soft Delete Indicator"
            }, 
            "roles": {
                "user":"Simple User",
                "Admin":"Admin User",
                "Super":"Super User"
            }
        }
    }    
]
```
This information is always loaded into the Enumerators collection, and is used by enum [Schema Pre-Processing directives](#schema-pre-processing).

A note on enumerator volatility. Most data fields can be enumerated, however in cases where the enumerated list is higly volatile and users can 
create new values, then use of the enum constraint is not appropriate. That being said - most data fields will see their enumerator list remain 
highly static after some initial growth. The msm tool makes it very easy to add a new enumerated value to the system, so in cases where the volitality 
is unknown you can start with a enum constraint, and if the volatility doesn't settle in the first few months of use, refactor to a more appropriate pattern. 

## Version Processing
When msm is processing a collection, the current version of the collection is examined, and if a newer version is provided then that version is "implemented" by executing the following steps in order:
- Remove schema validation from the collection
- Drop Indexes *if specified*
- Run Migration Pipelines *if provided*
- Create Indexes *if specified*
- Apply Schema
- Load Test Data *if requested*
- Update collection Version document

This is repeated until the newest collection version has been implemented.

## Indexing
Having proper indexing in places is a key element of making sure that your database is performant. The ``addIndexs`` property of the version allows you to add any number of indexes to a collection. Indexes are provided in standard Mongo format, but the name property is required. For example:

```json
"addIndexes": [
    {
        "name": "nameIndex",
        "key": {"userName": 1},
        "options": {"unique": true}
    }
]
```

Having unused indexes creates unnecessary overhead on insert and update operations. The ``dropIndexs`` property can be used to specify a list of index names to be dropped. For example:

```json
"dropIndexes": ["nameIndex"]
```

## Migration Pipelines
Not all schema changes can be handled by simply loading a new schema. Unfortunately sometimes a migration is required to change the data in the database to comply with a new schema. Mongo aggregation pipelines specified in the ``aggregations`` attribute are executed to facilitate this functionality. Any Mongo DB aggregation pipeline will run but here are some examples to get you started:

### Add new property with default values
```json
"aggregations": [
    [
        {
            "$match": {
                "name": { "$ne": "VERSION" }
            }
        },
        {
            "$addFields": {
                "newProperty": "Default Value"
            },
            "$merge": {
                "into": "sample",
                "on": "_id",
                "whenMatched": "replace",
                "whenNotMatched": "discard"
            }
        }
    ]
]

```

### Drop a depricated property
```json
"aggregations": [
    [
        {
            "$unset": "oldField"  
        },
        {            
            "$merge": {
                "into": "sample",
                "on": "_id",
                "whenMatched": "replace",
                "whenNotMatched": "discard"
            }
        }
    ]
]
```

### Update a property (remove spaces from userName)
```json
"aggregations": [
[
    {
        "$set": {
            "userName": {
                "$replaceAll": {
                    "input": "$userName",
                    "find": " ",
                    "replacement": ""
                }
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "$merge": {
            "into": "collectionName",  
            "on": "_id",  
            "whenMatched": "replace",  
            "whenNotMatched": "discard"  
        }
    }
]
]
```

## Schema Pre-Processing
The schema's processed by msm can be any valid mongoDB schema. However the tool provides several schema pre-processing directives that can be used to introduce reusable custom types, or enumerations more easily. These Directives are msm type descriptions that take the place of a bsonType attribute in your schema. During pre-processing these msm type properties are replaced with the appropriate bson schema components.

Schema file names are 3-element version specific, that is to say if the collection configuration file has a collection name of ``sample`` and a collection version of ``1.2.3.4`` the tool will look for a schema file with the name ``sample-1.2.3.json`` and use ``"version": 4``of the system enumerations when processing the schema. 

### msmType
The MSM type directive provides a way to implement reusable custom types. The property provided with this directive is the name of the custom type file used. For example, 

Given a schemas/collection.json with
```json
{
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "description": "A user name",
            "msmType":"customNameType"
        }
    }
}
```

and a customTypes/customNameType.json with
```json
{
    "bsonType": "string", 
    "maxLength": 32
}
```

the resulting schema that is applied will be
```json
{
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "description": "A user name",
            "bsonType": "string", 
            "maxLength": 32
        }
    }
}
```

msm introduces a set of custom types that represent a new set of type primitives.

Given a schemas/collection.json with
```json
{
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "description": "A user name",
            "msmType":"msmWord"
        }
    }
}
```

the resulting schema that is applied will be
```json
{
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "description": "A user name",
            "bsonType": "string",
	        "pattern": "^[^\\s]{0,32}$"
        }
    }
}
```

For a list of the available msmType primitives, see files in [the msmTypes folder](../src/msmTypes/)

### msmEnums
The msmEnums directive is used to provide an enumerated list of valid values, from the system enumerators file, for a property. For example:

Given a schemas/collection.json with
```json
{
    "status": {
        "description": "The status",
        "msmEnums": "defaultStatus"
    }
}
```

And a enumerators/enumerators.json with
```json
{
    "enumerators": {
        "defaultStatus": {
            "Active":"Not Deleted",
            "Archived":"Soft Delete Indicator"
        }
    }
}
```

The schema applied will be
```json
{
    "status": {
        "description": "The status",
        "bsonType": "string",
        "enum": [
            "Active",
            "Archived"
        ]
    }
}
```

### msmEnumList
Similar to the ``msmEnums`` directive this directive creates a list of the enumerated values from the system enumerations data, and applies it to an array of strings

Given a schemas/collection.json with
```json
{
    "tags": {
        "description": "A list of tags",
        "msmEnumList": "tags"
    }
}
```

And a enumerators/enumerators.json with
```json
{
    "enumerators": {
        "tags": {
            "Loud": "A loud item",
            "Important": "Something Important"
        }
    }
}
```

The schema applied will be
```json
{
    "status": {
        "description": "A list of tags",
        "bsonType": "array",
        "items": {
            "bsonType": "string",
            "enum": [
                "Loud",
                "Important"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## Loading Test Data
If a test data property is provided in the collection version configuration, it is the file name (without a json extension)
```json
"testData": "sample-1.0.0.2"
```
If the LOAD_TEST_DATA configuration value is set to ``true`` then the contents of testData/sample-1.0.0.2.json will read 
and bulk loaded into the collection when the version is applied. 

Test data is pre-processed by the mongo [EJSON](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mongodb-extended-json/) library which handles bson primitives such as:
```json
"_id": {"$oid":"123456789012345678901234"}
"date": {"$date": "2/27/2024 18:17:58"}
```

## The Collection Version Document
Each collection will have a collection version document, so you must account for these properties in your schema.
```json
{
    "name": "VERSION",
    "version": "1.2.3.4"
}
```
